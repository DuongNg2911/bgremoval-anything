This tool provide a much more flexible way to remove the background of an image, with the help of SAM (Segment Anything Model) you can now select the object you want to keep and remove all the not needed by a single click or drawing a bounding box onto that object. As an ex-designer, I firmly believe that this tool not only help designer to save more time but also enhance the quality of their product.
